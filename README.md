# TAFE-Assignment-ASP.NET-Charity-Kitchen-Ordering-System
Simple ASP.NET WebForms ordering system made for an assignment. Everything here is exactly how it was when I submitted the assignment (At least I hope I uploaded that version). There are some pointless things in here that were put there to meet the criteria of the assignment (some of the stuff in the documentation file)

## Assignment Case Study: Charity Kitchen

An organisation that employs volunteers to make meals for community services clientele. At present, their workplace operates entirely on pen and paper notes. At present, a community service operator will send through a fax containing an order of meals selected from a list of options offered by the kitchen. This list is then transformed into a list of ingredients, which is passed along to their warehouse to be acquired either from stocks available or to be purchased. The ingredients make their way to the kitchens, where they’re turned into the requested order and packed for delivery by courier on the following day.

The kitchen wants to remove pen and paper from the workplace entirely, to be replaced with emails instead of faxes and computers instead of notepads. They’d like a web site made with screens for each of the workplace areas so everyone can use the same application, which should help reduce wastage and miscommunications in the workplace.

Your task is to design an application suiting this purpose in C# ASP.NET.
